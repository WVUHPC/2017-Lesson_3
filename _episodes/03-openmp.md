# Parallel Programming with OpenMP

OpenMP is an Application Program Interface (API). 
OpenMP provides a portable, scalable model for developers of shared memory parallel applications. 
The API supports C/C++ and Fortran on a wide variety of architectures. 
This tutorial covers some of the major features of OpenMP 4.0, including its various constructs and directives for specifying parallel regions, work sharing, synchronization and data environment. 
Runtime library functions and environment variables are also covered. 
This tutorial includes both C and Fortran example codes and a lab exercise.
